    "generalExplanation": "Lisinopril is an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) used for treating hypertension, heart failure, and myocardial infarction. It works by inhibiting the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II, which can lead to myocyte hypertrophy and vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation if untreated. This drug has a wide therapeutic index and a long duration of action.",
    "detailedExplanation": "Lisinopril's mechanism of action involves the inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme, which prevents the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II. This action prevents myocyte hypertrophy and vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation seen in untreated patients. Increased levels of bradykinin also exhibit vasodilating effects for patients taking ACEIs. Lisinopril also inhibits renin's conversion of angiotensin to angiotensin I.",
    "generalAdvice": "Patients should be aware of the potential for hypotension, especially in the case of an overdose. In such cases, patients should be treated with intravenous saline to restore blood pressure. Lisinopril can be removed from the blood by hemodialysis due to it not being protein bound.",
    "pharmacologicalExplanation": "Lisinopril is not a prodrug, and functions by inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme as well as the renin angiotensin aldosterone system. It has a wide therapeutic index and a long duration of action as patients are generally given 10-80mg daily.",

    "generalExplanation": "Valsartan, an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB), can interact with other medications and cause side effects such as hypotension, impaired renal function, and hyperkalemia. It is also known to be harmful in pregnancy.",
    "detailedExplanation": "Valsartan can cause excessive hypotension, especially in patients with an activated renin-angiotensin system or those receiving high doses of diuretics. It can also lead to changes in renal function, including acute renal failure, particularly in patients whose renal function may depend in part on the activity of the renin-angiotensin system. Additionally, some patients with heart failure have developed increases in potassium due to Valsartan. These effects are usually minor and transient, but they are more likely to occur in patients with pre-existing renal impairment.",
    "generalAdvice": "Patients should be monitored closely for signs of hypotension, renal function impairment, and hyperkalemia. Valsartan should be discontinued as soon as possible when pregnancy is detected.",
    "pharmacologicalExplanation": "Valsartan works by selectively binding to angiotensin receptor 1 (AT1) and preventing angiotensin II from binding and exerting its hypertensive effects.

It works by inhibiting the reabsorption of sodium and water in the kidneys, leading to increased urine output. This can affect the balance of electrolytes in your body, particularly potassium, which can lead to hypokalemia (low potassium levels).",
    "detailedExplanation": "Hydrochlorothiazide acts on the proximal region of the distal convoluted tubule, inhibiting reabsorption by the sodium-chloride symporter, SLC12A3. This reduces the concentration gradient between the epithelial cell and distal convoluted tubule, reducing the reabsorption of water. The result is an increase in the excretion of water and sodium in the urine. However, this can also lead to a decrease in potassium levels, which can cause symptoms such as muscle weakness, irregular heartbeat, and mood changes.",
    "generalAdvice": "Hydrochlorothiazide should be used with caution in patients with reduced kidney or liver function. Regular monitoring of electrolytes, particularly potassium, is recommended during treatment with this medication.",

It is generally well-tolerated but can interact with other medications, particularly those that also affect liver function or cholesterol metabolism.",
    "detailedExplanation": "Pravastatin's mechanism of action involves the inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase, an enzyme involved in cholesterol synthesis in the liver. This inhibition results in decreased cholesterol production, increased LDL receptor expression, and enhanced LDL metabolism and clearance. This leads to a reduction in circulating total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and apolipoprotein B, and a modest decrease in VLDL cholesterol and triglycerides. It also increases HDL cholesterol and apolipoprotein A levels. In clinical trials, it has been shown to reduce the risk of death due to coronary disease.",
    "generalAdvice": "Patients should inform their healthcare provider of all medications they are currently taking, as pravastatin can interact with other drugs. In the case of overdose, symptomatic treatment along with laboratory monitoring and supportive measures are recommended.",

    "generalExplanation": "Venlafaxine is an antidepressant medication that works by increasing the levels of neurotransmitters in the synapse. It is generally well-tolerated but can interact with certain other medications.",
    "detailedExplanation": "Venlafaxine selectively inhibits the reuptake of both serotonin and norepinephrine at the presynaptic terminal, resulting in increased levels of these neurotransmitters available at the synapse. It also weakly inhibits dopamine reuptake. Overdose can lead to symptoms such as somnolence, dizziness, altered consciousness, and potentially serious cardiac effects.",
    "generalAdvice": "Always take venlafaxine as prescribed by your healthcare provider. Do not exceed the recommended dose. If you suspect an overdose, seek immediate medical attention.",
    "pharmacologicalExplanation": "Venlafaxine and its active metabolite O-desmethylvenlafaxine (ODV) potently and selectively inhibit the reuptake of both serotonin and norepinephrine at the presynaptic terminal. This results in increased levels of these neurotransmitters available at the synapse. At higher doses, venlafaxine also inhibits dopamine reuptake. The risk of fatal outcomes from venlafaxine overdosage is higher than that of SSRI antidepressants, but lower than that of tricyclic antidepressants.",

  "Duloxetine": {
    "interactionRiskLevel": "MODERATE",
    "generalExplanation": "Duloxetine is a potent inhibitor of neuronal serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake, with less potent inhibition of dopamine reuptake. It is used for various conditions including depression, anxiety, and certain types of chronic pain. However, it may cause increased blood pressure due to vasoconstriction mediated by the intended increase in norepinephrine signaling.",
    "detailedExplanation": "Duloxetine enhances glutamatergic activation of the pudendal motor nerve, which allows for stronger contraction of the external urethral sphincter. This can increase the pressure needed to produce an incontinence episode in stress urinary incontinence. It also strengthens the serotonergic and adrenergic pathways involved in descending inhibition of pain, which can increase the threshold of activation necessary to transmit painful stimuli to the brain.",
    "generalAdvice": "Patients should be monitored for increased blood pressure and other side effects. In case of overdose, supportive care is recommended along with activated charcoal and gastric lavage to reduce absorption.",
    "pharmacologicalExplanation": "Duloxetine's hypertensive effect is related to its intended pharmacological effect. Increased availability of norepinephrine leads to activation of adrenergic receptors on the vascular endothelium. Since the action of α1 receptors predominates, vasoconstriction results as the Gq coupled receptor mediates calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum to facilitate smooth muscle contraction.",

    "detailedExplanation": "Bupropion's inhibitory effects on the norepinephrine transporter (NET) are thought to contribute to its pro-convulsant activity, increasing the risk of seizures, especially when combined with other drugs or substances that lower the seizure threshold. It also increases blood pressure, posing a risk for exacerbation of unmanaged or pre-existing hypertension. Despite its therapeutic benefits, bupropion has been identified as having an abuse potential due to its stimulant effects and selective activity at dopamine and norepinephrine receptors.",
    "generalAdvice": "Patients should be closely monitored for changes in behavior, mood, or seizure activity. Blood pressure should be regularly checked, and the medication should be used with caution in patients with a history of hypertension. Due to its abuse potential, careful patient selection and monitoring is necessary.",

    "generalExplanation": "Mirtazapine is an antidepressant medication with a unique mechanism of action, acting on various neurotransmitter systems in the brain. It is effective in treating moderate to severe depression and has additional effects on appetite, weight gain, and sleep. However, it carries a risk of suicidal ideation and behavior, especially in younger individuals. It also has potential interactions with other medications and substances.",
    "detailedExplanation": "Mirtazapine increases both noradrenergic and serotonergic activity in the brain by antagonizing presynaptic α2-adrenergic inhibitory autoreceptors and heteroreceptors. It also antagonizes peripheral α1-adrenergic receptors, which may cause orthostatic hypotension, and histamine (H1) receptors, contributing to its sedative effects. Mirtazapine has been shown to improve symptoms of depression, enhance appetite and weight gain, and improve sleep quality. However, it may increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors, particularly in younger individuals. The drug's toxicity profile includes potential hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas at high doses in animal studies, and potential impairment of fertility.",

It also has potential for overdose, with symptoms including sedation, tachycardia, and hypotension.",
    "detailedExplanation": "Quetiapine's mechanism of action is not fully understood, but it is known to antagonize dopamine type 2 (D2) and serotonin 2A (5HT2A) receptors, which may explain its efficacy in treating schizophrenia. In bipolar depression and major depression, its actions may be attributed to the binding of this drug or its metabolite to the norepinephrine transporter. It also has other effects, including somnolence, orthostatic hypotension, and anticholinergic effects, which may result from the antagonism of H1 receptors, adrenergic α1 receptors, and muscarinic M1 receptors.",
    "generalAdvice": "Quetiapine should be used with caution in young patients due to the risk of suicidal thinking, and it is not recommended for use in children under 10 years of age.

It works by blocking D2 dopaminergic and 5-HT2A serotonergic receptors in the brain, thus reducing the overactivity of certain pathways that contribute to these conditions. However, it may interact with other medications that also affect these neurotransmitter systems.",
    "detailedExplanation": "Risperidone has a high binding affinity for serotonergic 5-HT2A receptors and a moderate affinity for dopaminergic D2 receptors. This balance helps to reduce both the positive symptoms (like delusions and hallucinations) and negative symptoms (like depression and decreased motivation) of schizophrenia. It also reduces the risk of extrapyramidal symptoms, which are movement disorders that can occur with antipsychotic medications. However, interactions may occur with other drugs that affect these same neurotransmitter systems, potentially altering the effectiveness of the medication or increasing side effects.",
    "generalAdvice": "Always inform your healthcare provider about all medications you are currently taking, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements. This will help to avoid potential drug interactions. If you experience any unusual side effects while taking risperidone, contact your healthcare provider immediately.",
    "pharmacologicalExplanation": "Risperidone works by transiently inhibiting D2 dopaminergic receptors and 5-HT2A serotonergic receptors in the brain. This reduces the overactivity of central mesolimbic and mesocortical pathways, which are thought to contribute to the symptoms of schizophrenia. Risperidone also has antagonist activity at alpha-1, alpha-2, and histamine H1 receptors, which may further contribute to its therapeutic effects.",

However, it is ineffective in absence seizures and should be used with caution in patients with mixed seizure disorders involving absence seizures.",
    "detailedExplanation": "Gabapentin works primarily by inhibiting the action of α2δ-1 subunits, thus decreasing the density of pre-synaptic voltage-gated calcium channels and subsequent release of excitatory neurotransmitters. This is likely responsible for the anti-epileptic action of gabapentin. There is some evidence that gabapentin also acts on adenosine receptors and voltage-gated potassium channels, though the clinical relevance of its action at these sites is unclear.",
    "generalAdvice": "Gabapentin should be used with caution in patients with mixed seizure disorders involving absence seizures. It has been associated with drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), otherwise known as multi-organ hypersensitivity. This reaction can prove fatal and early symptoms such as fever, lymphadenopathy, and rash should be promptly investigated.",
    "pharmacologicalExplanation": "Gabapentin has a wide therapeutic index, with doses in excess of 8000 mg/kg failing to cause a fatal reaction in rats. Symptoms of overdose are consistent with the drug's adverse effect profile and involve CNS depression and gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea. Gabapentin can be removed by hemodialysis - this may be of benefit in some patients, such as those with impaired renal function.",

    "generalExplanation": "Pregabalin is a medication primarily used to treat epilepsy, neuropathic pain, fibromyalgia, and generalized anxiety disorder. It works by binding to the alpha2-delta subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels in the central nervous system, modulating the release of several excitatory neurotransmitters.",
    "detailedExplanation": "Although the exact mechanism of action is not fully understood, pregabalin's effects are believed to result from its binding to the alpha2-delta subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels in the central nervous system. This binding modulates the release of several excitatory neurotransmitters, including glutamate, substance-P, norepinephrine, and calcitonin gene related peptide. Pregabalin does not bind directly to GABA or benzodiazepine receptors, despite being a structural derivative of the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA).",
    "generalAdvice": "Patients should be monitored for adverse effects such as vertigo, dizziness, balance disorder, incoordination, ataxia, blurred vision, diplopia, amblyopia, somnolence, confusional state, tremor, disturbance in attention, abnormal thinking, asthenia, fatigue, euphoria, edema, peripheral edema, dry mouth, and constipation. In case of overdose, supportive care is recommended, and in severe cases, extra-corporeal elimination methods including haemodialysis may be considered.",
    "pharmacologicalExplanation": "Pregabalin works by binding to the alpha2-delta subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels in the central nervous system, modulating the release of several excitatory neurotransmitters.

It has a prolonged action due to its ability to bind reversibly to albumin, allowing it to be released slowly over time.",
    "detailedExplanation": "Liraglutide is an acylated synthetic glucagon-like peptide-1 analog. It acts as an agonist of the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor, which is coupled to adenylate cyclase. This increases cyclic AMP, stimulating the glucose-dependent release of insulin and inhibiting the glucose-dependent release of glucagon. It also slows gastric emptying, which helps control blood sugar levels.

Patients with renal or hepatic impairment may be at increased risk of hypoglycemia and may require more frequent insulin lispro dose adjustment and more frequent blood glucose monitoring.",
    "detailedExplanation": "Insulin lispro binds to the insulin receptor (IR), a heterotetrameric protein consisting of two extracellular alpha units and two transmembrane beta units. The binding of insulin to the alpha subunit of IR stimulates the tyrosine kinase activity intrinsic to the beta subunit of the receptor. The bound receptor autophosphorylates and phosphorylates numerous intracellular substrates such as insulin receptor substrates (IRS) proteins, Cbl, APS, Shc and Gab 1. Activation of these proteins leads to the activation of downstream signaling molecules including PI3 kinase and Akt.

Overdose can lead to a hypermetabolic state similar to thyrotoxicosis, with symptoms such as weight loss, increased appetite, palpitations, nervousness, diarrhea, abdominal cramps, sweating, tachycardia, increased pulse and blood pressure, cardiac arrhythmias, tremors, insomnia, heat intolerance, fever, and menstrual irregularities.",
    "detailedExplanation": "Levothyroxine exerts its effects by diffusing into the cell nucleus and binding to thyroid hormone receptors in DNA regions called thyroid hormone response elements (TREs) near genes. This complex of T4, T3, DNA, and other coregulatory proteins causes a conformational change and a resulting shift in transcriptional regulation of nearby genes, synthesis of messenger RNA, and cytoplasmic protein production. Overdose can lead to a hypermetabolic state similar to thyrotoxicosis.",
    "generalAdvice": "Patients should be monitored for their response to titration to avoid overdose. TSH levels should be monitored at least yearly to avoid over-treating with levothyroxine which can result in hyperthyroidism and symptoms of increased heart rate, diarrhea, tremor, hypercalcemia, and weakness to name a few. In populations with any cardiac concerns, levothyroxine should be initiated at lower doses than those recommended in younger individuals or in patients without cardiac disease.",
    "pharmacologicalExplanation": "Levothyroxine is a synthetic hormone that exerts the same physiologic effect as endogenous T4, thereby maintaining normal T4 levels when a deficiency is present. Over- or under-treatment with levothyroxine may have negative effects on growth and development, cardiovascular function, bone metabolism, reproductive function, cognitive function, emotional state, gastrointestinal function and glucose and lipid metabolism.",

    "detailedExplanation": "Methimazole's primary mechanism of action is interference in an early step in thyroid hormone synthesis involving thyroid peroxidase (TPO). It may directly inhibit TPO or act as a competitive substrate for TPO, thus interfering with the iodination of thyroglobulin. Onset of action occurs within 12 to 18 hours, and its duration of action is 36 to 72 hours. The most serious potential side effect of methimazole therapy is agranulocytosis, and other cytopenias may also occur. There also exists the potential for severe hepatic toxicity with the use of methimazole.",
    "generalAdvice": "Patients should be instructed to monitor for, and report, any signs or symptoms of agranulocytosis such as fever or sore throat.

    "generalExplanation": "Pioglitazone is a medication used to treat type 2 diabetes. It works by making the body more sensitive to insulin, a hormone that regulates the absorption of sugar into cells for energy. However, it may cause fluid retention leading to congestive heart failure and may be associated with an increased risk of bladder cancer.",
    "detailedExplanation": "Pioglitazone activates PPARγ, a receptor in tissues where insulin acts, such as adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, and liver. This activation increases the transcription of insulin-responsive genes, enhancing tissue sensitivity to insulin and reducing the hepatic production of glucose. This improves insulin resistance associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus without increasing insulin secretion by pancreatic beta cells. However, it can cause significant fluid retention leading to congestive heart failure and may be associated with an increased risk of bladder cancer.",
    "generalAdvice": "Pioglitazone should be used with caution in patients with a history of heart failure or bladder cancer. Regular monitoring for signs of fluid retention and bladder abnormalities is recommended.

    "generalExplanation": "Omeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor that reduces gastric acid secretion. It is generally safe and effective, but it may interact with other medications and can cause side effects.",
    "detailedExplanation": "Omeprazole works by inhibiting the H+/K+ ATPase enzyme system, reducing the production of stomach acid. This can help treat conditions like gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), ulcers, and H. pylori infections. However, it can also increase serum gastrin levels and cause enterochromaffin-like cell hyperplasia. Long-term use may potentially influence the development of premalignant or malignant conditions, although current studies are insufficient to draw definitive conclusions. Overdose can lead to symptoms like confusion, drowsiness, and nausea, and there is evidence of carcinogenic and mutagenic effects in animal studies. Omeprazole may also be present in human milk, potentially affecting breastfed infants.",
    "generalAdvice": "Patients should use omeprazole as directed by their healthcare provider and report any side effects. They should also inform their healthcare provider of all other medications they are taking to avoid potential interactions.",
    "pharmacologicalExplanation": "Omeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor that works by blocking the H+/K+ ATPase enzyme system on the gastric parietal cells.

However, long-term use may increase susceptibility to certain bacterial infections, reduce absorption of micronutrients, contribute to osteoporosis and bone fractures, and increase risk of cardiovascular events.",
    "detailedExplanation": "Pantoprazole works by inhibiting the H+/K+ ATPase enzyme, which is responsible for the final step in gastric acid secretion. This leads to a decrease in stomach acidity. However, long-term use has been associated with increased susceptibility to bacterial infections, reduced absorption of micronutrients including iron and B12, and an increased risk of developing hypomagnesemia and hypocalcemia which may contribute to osteoporosis and bone fractures. Additionally, pantoprazole has been shown to inhibit the activity of dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH), an enzyme necessary for cardiovascular health. This could lead to an increased risk of cardiovascular events in patients with unstable coronary syndromes.",
    "generalAdvice": "Patients should be aware of these potential risks when considering long-term use of pantoprazole. Regular monitoring of nutrient levels and cardiovascular health may be necessary.",
    "pharmacologicalExplanation": "Pantoprazole is a substituted benzimidazole derivative that accumulates in the acidic space of the parietal cell before being converted to active sulfenamide derivatives.

There are no known severe drug interactions with famotidine, but it's always important to inform your healthcare provider about all medications you're currently taking.",
    "detailedExplanation": "Famotidine's mechanism of action involves the inhibition of histamine action on H2 receptors, which are expressed on the basolateral membrane of parietal cells in the stomach. This leads to decreased intracellular cAMP levels and reduced activity of proton pumps on parietal cells, thereby reducing the secretion of acid into the stomach. This can help in conditions associated with acid hypersecretion such as ulcers.",
    "generalAdvice": "Always take famotidine as directed by your healthcare provider. In case of overdose, seek immediate medical attention. Symptoms of overdose may resemble the adverse events seen with the use of recommended doses. Hemodialysis may be used to eliminate the drug from the systemic circulation, although its use in response to famotidine overdose is limited.",
    "pharmacologicalExplanation": "Famotidine has a dose-dependent therapeutic action, with the highest dose having the most extended duration of action and the highest inhibitory effect on gastric acid secretion.

    "pharmacologicalExplanation": "Ondansetron is a highly specific and selective serotonin 5-HT3 receptor antagonist. It works by blocking the action of serotonin, a natural substance that may cause nausea and vomiting. The serotonin 5-HT3 receptors are located on the nerve terminals of the vagus in the periphery, and centrally in the chemoreceptor trigger zone of the area postrema. The temporal relationship between the emetogenic action of emetogenic drugs and the release of serotonin, as well as the efficacy of antiemetic agents, suggest that chemotherapeutic agents release serotonin from the enterochromaffin cells of the small intestine by causing degenerative changes in the GI tract.",

    "generalExplanation": "Azathioprine is an immunosuppressive medication that works by inhibiting purine synthesis and inducing T cell apoptosis. It has a long duration of action and a narrow therapeutic index, which means that the difference between a therapeutic dose and a toxic dose is small. Therefore, it's important to take this medication exactly as prescribed by your healthcare provider.",
    "detailedExplanation": "Azathioprine's mechanism of action is not entirely understood, but it may be related to inhibition of purine synthesis and inhibition of B and T cells. A metabolite of azathioprine, 6-thioguanine triphosphate, modulates activation of rac1 when costimulated with CD28, inducing T cell apoptosis. This may be mediated through rac1's action on mitogen-activated protein kinase, NF-kappaB. Patients taking azathioprine should be counseled regarding the risk of skin malignancies and lymphomas.",
    "generalAdvice": "Patients should be aware of the risks associated with azathioprine, including the potential for skin malignancies and lymphomas. Regular monitoring by a healthcare provider is necessary while taking this medication. In case of an overdose, immediate medical attention is necessary as it may lead to bone marrow hypoplasia, bleeding, and infection, which can be fatal.",
    "pharmacologicalExplanation": "Azathioprine is an immunosuppressive agent that works by modulating rac1 to induce T cell apoptosis. It also has other unknown immunosuppressive functions. The medication has a long duration of action and is given daily. It has a narrow therapeutic index, meaning the difference between a therapeutic dose and a toxic dose is small.",

  "Sirolimus": {
    "interactionRiskLevel": "MODERATE",
    "generalExplanation": "Sirolimus is an immunosuppressant drug with antifungal and antitumour effects. It works by inhibiting T-lymphocyte activation and proliferation, thus suppressing the immune system. This can lead to an increased risk of infections and other immune-related complications. Sirolimus has a narrow therapeutic index, meaning the difference between an effective dose and a toxic dose is small. Overdose symptoms are consistent with the adverse effects of sirolimus.",
    "detailedExplanation": "Sirolimus binds to the cytoplasmic receptor FK506-binding protein-12 (FKBP12) to form an immunosuppressive complex. This complex inhibits the activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a protein kinase that regulates cell growth, proliferation, survival, mobility, and angiogenesis. Inhibition of mTOR leads to the suppression of cytokine-driven T-cell proliferation, thus inhibiting the progression from the G1 to the S phase of the cell cycle. Sirolimus also inhibits antibody production.",
    "generalAdvice": "Patients taking sirolimus should be monitored for signs of infection and other immune-related complications. In the event of an overdose, general supportive measures are recommended as sirolimus is not expected to be dialyzable to any significant extent.",
    "pharmacologicalExplanation": "Sirolimus works by inhibiting T-lymphocyte activation and proliferation stimulated by antigens and cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-2, IL-4, and IL-15. In target cells, sirolimus binds to the cytoplasmic receptor FK506-binding protein-12 (FKBP12), an immunophilin, to form an immunosuppressive complex. FKBP12-sirolimus complex binds to and inhibits the activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), which is a serine/threonine-specific protein kinase that regulates cell growth, proliferation, survival, mobility, and angiogenesis.",

    "generalExplanation": "Methotrexate is a medication that inhibits enzymes responsible for nucleotide synthesis, which prevents cell division and leads to anti-inflammatory actions. It has a long duration of action and is generally given to patients once weekly. Methotrexate has a narrow therapeutic index, meaning that there is a small difference between a beneficial and a harmful dose. Therefore, it is crucial to take this medication as prescribed by your healthcare provider.",
    "detailedExplanation": "Methotrexate works by inhibiting enzymes responsible for nucleotide synthesis, including dihydrofolate reductase, thymidylate synthase, aminoimidazole carboxamide ribonucleotide transformylase (AICART), and amido phosphoribosyltransferase. This inhibition prevents cell division. In rheumatoid arthritis, methotrexate polyglutamates inhibit AICART more than methotrexate. This inhibition leads to an accumulation of AICART ribonucleotide, which inhibits adenosine deaminase, leading to an accumulation of adenosine triphosphate and adenosine in the extracellular space, stimulating adenosine receptors, leading to anti-inflammatory action.",
    "generalAdvice": "Do not take methotrexate daily. Always follow your healthcare provider's instructions for taking this medication. If you suspect an overdose, seek immediate medical attention.",
    "pharmacologicalExplanation": "Methotrexate is converted to a methotrexate polyglutamate in tissues, which inhibits enzymes responsible for nucleotide synthesis, preventing cell division and leading to anti-inflammatory actions.

  "Tamoxifen": {
    "interactionRiskLevel": "MODERATE",
    "generalExplanation": "Tamoxifen is a selective estrogen receptor modulator used primarily in the treatment of breast cancer. It works by inhibiting the growth and promoting apoptosis in estrogen receptor positive tumors. However, it has a narrow therapeutic index and higher doses can lead to serious side effects such as breathing difficulty or convulsions. It is also associated with an increased incidence of uterine malignancies.",
    "detailedExplanation": "Tamoxifen competitively inhibits estrogen binding to its receptor, which is critical for its activity in breast cancer cells. This leads to a decrease in tumor growth factor α and insulin-like growth factor 1, and an increase in sex hormone binding globulin. The increase in sex hormone binding globulin limits the amount of freely available estradiol. These changes reduce levels of factors that stimulate tumor growth. Tamoxifen has also been shown to induce apoptosis in estrogen receptor positive cells. This action is thought to be the result of inhibition of protein kinase C, which prevents DNA synthesis.",
    "generalAdvice": "Patients should be closely monitored for side effects and dosage adjustments may be necessary to minimize risk. Regular check-ups for uterine malignancies should also be conducted due to the increased risk associated with Tamoxifen use.",
    "pharmacologicalExplanation": "Tamoxifen is a selective estrogen receptor modulator. It inhibits growth and promotes apoptosis in estrogen receptor positive tumors. Its active metabolite N-desmethyltamoxifen has a half life of approximately 2 weeks, contributing to its long duration of action. However, it has a narrow therapeutic index and higher doses can lead to serious side effects.",

  "Letrozole": {
    "interactionRiskLevel": "MODERATE",
    "generalExplanation": "Letrozole is a non-steroidal type II aromatase inhibitor used in the treatment of estrogen-dependent breast cancers. It works by blocking the conversion of androgens to estrogen, leading to a reduction in the availability of estrogen and regression of estrogen-dependent tumors.",
    "detailedExplanation": "Letrozole inhibits the action of the enzyme aromatase, which converts androgens into estrogens. This action leads to a reduction in uterine weight and elevated leuteinizing hormone. In postmenopausal women, the action of aromatase is responsible for the majority of estrogen production. With reduced availability of estrogen, estrogen-dependent tumors regress. Letrozole has a long duration of action with a half-life of over 42 hours in breast cancer patients.",
    "generalAdvice": "Patients should be counselled regarding the risk of interstitial lung disease, pneumonitis, QT prolongation, elevated transaminase levels, neutropenia, and embryo-fetal toxicity.",
    "pharmacologicalExplanation": "Letrozole is a third generation type II aromatase inhibitor used to treat estrogen dependant breast cancers. It works by competitively inhibiting the active site, and therefore the electron transfer chain of CYP19A1, preventing the conversion of androgens to estrogen.",
